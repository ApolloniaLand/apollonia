# Apollonia
## About us
We are an anarchist micronation which lays claim to Marie Byrd land in Antartica. 
We seek to create a homeland for all lgbt+ people, so we may be free from the repressive and/or dangerous places we live.
We also have no issue accepting non-lgbt+ people, so long as they are our allies, and accept our principles.

## Our goals
We seek to raise funds which will go towards creating a permanent outpost in Marie Byrd land.
If we are able to accomplish this, we further intend to establish a mutual aid fund which will be used to needy queer people into our community.
