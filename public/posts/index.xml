      <description>Apollonia About us We are an anarchist micronation which lays claim to Marie Byrd land in Antartica. We seek to create a homeland for all lgbt+ people, so we may be free from the repressive and/or dangerous places we live. We also have no issue accepting non-lgbt+ people, so long as they are our allies, and accept our principles.
Our goals We seek to raise funds which will go towards creating a permanent outpost in Marie Byrd land.</description>
